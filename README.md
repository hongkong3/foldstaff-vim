Does it also display in color? `#ff8020`  
This is something else...  

strings  *em* **strong**  
***Isn't it possible to display in color?***

<details style='color:red'>
    <summary>Tag is enable?</summary>
    Hidden messages.<br>
    The markdown doesn't work in tags.<br><br>
    Is it possible that <kbd style='color:red;font-size:3em'>style</kbd> are also enabled too?<br>
    So tags work, but <code fg="#ff0000">attributes</code> don't...<br>
</details>
