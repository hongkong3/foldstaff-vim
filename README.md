This plugin is utilities for *Folding* at **Vim editor**.   
The settings for each utility, can be switched for each `filetype`.  


### [foldstaff-vim][ghp] provides the bellow utilities: 

* [**foldstaff-header**](#user-content-foldstaff-header)  
  For *foldtext*.  Generates the display Text of closed Folding.  
  You can freely edit the content to be displayed using *formatting-text* as like the `statusline`.  
  And you can set the *formatting-text* for each `filetype` and each `foldlevel`.  
  You can also specify the length of the display Text.  

* [**foldstaff-marker**](#user-content-foldstaff-marker)  
  Set the `fold-marker`, with right-side aligned.  
  That is almot all there is to it.   

* [**foldstaff-fold**](#user-content-foldstaff-fold)  
  Folding method for *foldexpr*, when the `fold-expr`.  
  This has some folding types:<br>
  - *type = "code"*  
    This is for Code or Script buffer.  
    This is similar to `fold-indent`, but folding into the previous paret level line. ~~(like as VS-Code)~~  
    And, `fold-marker`, etc. can also uses.  
  - *type = "text"*  
    This is mainly for *Vim-help*.  
    Folding buffer individually, after separating them with horizontal line and blank line.  
    The result looks like **an outline** or **table of contents**.  
  - *type = "match"*  
    Judges and folds each line using a pre-defined matching-patterns.
    
* [**foldstaff-option**](#user-content-foldstaff-option)  
  This is a function for **option setting**, for above utilities.  
  Although it is possible to set global-variable`g:` as in general plugins, this function allows you to check and reflect the values immediately.

## Usage
For more information on how to use it, please see the help in Vim.  
`:h foldstaff`  
  
### Quick start:
Place this in your *.vimrc*: 
```vim
let g:enable_foldstaff = 1
```
This will allow you to use all the utilities.

The following is an introduction of how to use and set up each of them individually.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
### foldstaff-header:
This is used as a callback function for *foldtext* from **Vim**.  
In usage, it is more important to edit the *formatting-text*.  

The text on the line with first non-symbolic character from *foldstart*, will be used as the **base-text**.  
(This means, that lines with only symbols as separators will be ignored)  

<br />

**Setup:**
```vim
:set foldtext=foldstaff#header()
```

<br />

> *CAUTION:*  
When changes to the base-text, will not realtime reflected in the folded-text.  
It will be updated by...  
 \* number of buffer-lines changed  
 \* window resized (window-columns changed)  
 \* execute `:FoldstaffOption` on current buffer  

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
### foldstaff-marker:
This is set the *fold-marker*. This function is designed to be used setting to *key-mapping*.

**Setup:**
```vim
:map zf <Plug>(foldstaff-marker)
:map zF <Plug>(foldstaff-endmarker)
```
`zf` and `zF` are just examples.  Feel free to set the actual **keys** as you wish.  
Two *key-mappings* are provided, for the `{{{`**start-marker**  and  `}}}`**end-marker**.  

<br />

At runtime, it works as follows:
- When executed in Normal-Mode, *fold-marker* will be placed by the behind of cursor line.  
  - if *fold-marker* already been placed, then remove it.  
```vim
  " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -{{{
```

- When executed with <em title="for example, an input like &#34;1zf&#34; or &#34;2zF&#34;.">&lt;count&gt;</em>[^fmr], place *fold-marker* for it **foldlevel**.
  - if *fold-marker* already been placed, then replace marker of new **foldlevel**. 
```vim
  " ===================================================={{{2
```

- When execute in Visual-Mode(multiline selected), will be placed **start-marker** on first-line, and **end-marker** on last-line.  
```vim
  for i in range(10) " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - {{{
    echo i
  endfor " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - }}}
```

<br />

Also, you can possible to set the character of fill at margin, for each **foldlevel**.  
There is unlimit characters, so you can do something like this.  
```vim
  " ( T T)/(^ ^ )`( - -)c(>_< )9_( T T)/(^ ^ )`( - -)c(>_{{{
```

[^fmr]: for example, an input like "1zf" or "2zF".

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
### foldstaff-fold:
This function is for *foldexpr*.   
This function performs folding according to the contents of the buffers.  

<br />

**Setup:**
```vim
:set foldmethod=expr foldexpr=foldstaff#fold()
```

This completes the configuration, but the settings will often be overwritten...  
It may be more constructive to execute the following **Ex-Command** as needed.  

<br />

**Command:**
```vim
:FoldstaffFold
:FoldstaffFold {type}
```
{type} cna be **code**, **text**, **match**, or **auto**.  
If {type} is omitted, then **auto** will be used.  
When **auto** is used, it will switch to **code** or **text** depending on the buffer contents.  

If **match** is specified, it cannot be executed unless `:FoldstaffOption fold.match = [...]` is set beforehand.  

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
### foldstaff-option:
This is a dedicated function for setting options for this plugin.  
A function version is also available, but I think it is easier to use the command.  

<br />

**Command:**
```vim
:FoldstaffOption
:FoldstaffOption {filetype}.{method}.{key} = {value}
:FoldstaffOption {filetype}.{method}.{key}[index] = {value}
```
When executed with no argument, if `g:foldstaff` exists, it will read the setting.  

If arguments are specified, it will change the setting to that value.  
The only part of the argument that is required is the `{key} = {value}` part.  
Arguments *{filetype}* and *{method}* can be omitted.  

For the about to be specified for *{filetype}*, *{method}* and *{key}*, please check [**Option**](#user-content-option) described below.  

<br />

After execution, it will display the changed *option-vriable*, and update [foldstaff-header](#user-content-foldstaff-header) and [foldstaff-fold](#user-content-foldstaff-fold).  
It also acquires the changed *option-variable* in register `h` as a string. (type `"hp` to paste it)

## Option
The option values in this plugin are managed by a DICT variable.  
The contents of this variable are as follows:  
```vim
    " @line-continuation "\" omitted.
    [g:]foldstaff = {
        "_" = #{                            " filetype [basic]
            header = #{                     " @ foldstaff-header
                format = [                  "   formatting text(s)
                    '%i%t %<%>%{repeat("[", %v)%}%L]',
                ],
                width = '+0',               "   max-length of folded text
                min = 8,                    "   min-length of base-text
                ellipsis = '~',             "   symbols when base-text omitted
                modify = [],                "   substitution-list to base-text
            },
            marker = #{                     " @ foldstaff-marker
                fill = [                    "   padding strings list
                    '- ',                   "     for non-level
                    '=', '_', '.',          "     for each foldlevel
                ],
                width = 0,                  "   length of fold marker
            },
            fold = #{                       " @ foldstaff-fold
                type = 'auto',              "   fold-type: [code/text/match/auto]
                keyswitch = -1,             "   za zo zc key-maps switch flag
                match = [],                 "   for fold-type:'match' (default is empty)
            },
        },
    " # The same settings as above can be added for each filetypes.
        "vim" = {
            ...
        },
        "help" = {
            ...
        }, ...
    }
```
See `:h foldstaff-option-detail` for details of each setting value.
