INTRODUCTION                                          *foldstaff-introduction*

"foldstaff" is utilities for Folding, as Vim-plugin.
About Folding, see |usr_28.txt| or |fold.txt|...

The settings can be switched for each |filetype|, by adding options.

REQUIRE
"Folding" is require the Vim is compiled with |+folding| feature.
You can check this by executing the following command. (8.2 later?) >
    :echo has('folding')
There may be something else you need, but I'm newbie by Vim so I am not sure.


This provides the bellow utilities:

+ |foldstaff-header|
    For 'foldtext'. Generates the display Text of closed Folding.
    If by adding format-text, you can set the formatting for
    each |filetype| and each |foldlevel|.

+ |foldstaff-marker|
    Set the |fold-marker|, with right-side aligned.
    That is almot all there is to it.

+ |foldstaff-fold|
    Folding method for 'foldexpr', when the |fold-expr|.
    This has some folding types.

- |foldstaff-option|
    This is a function for option setting, for above functions.
    Although it is possible to set global-variables[g:] as in general plugins,
    this function allows you to check and reflect the values immediately.

USAGE                                                        *foldstaff-usage*

The option settings are lumped together,
but each function is almost independent of the others.

You don't need to use all of them.


Quick Start ~
Write the fllowing in `vimrc`, and restart Vim. >
    let g:enable_foldstaff = 1
<
Keymap `zf` and `zF` are use to |foldstaff-marker|.
|foldstaff-header| and |foldstaff-fold| are automatically used.

Note: |:mkview| and |:loadview| ware use for restoring Folding in |autocmd|.
If you have problem, please edit relevant sections.
`(in /plugin/foldstaff.vim)`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Vim9 version]                                                *foldstaff-vim9*

If you put the following in vimrc: >
    let g:foldstaff_enable_vim9 = 1

Run each function in the |Vim9-script| version, if possible.

Note: that this may not work due to changes in |Vim9-script| verion.
      (Confirmed to work: gVim 8.2.4324)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

foldstaff-header                                            *foldstaff-header*

This function is for 'foldtext'.
Generate the display folded-text, as according to the formatting.

From |foldstart| line, the contents of the line with first character-string
will be used as the base-text.
(blank-lines and only-symbols-lines are ignored.)

Note:   When changes to the base-text,
        will not realtime reflected in the folded-text.
        It will be updated by...
        - number of buffer-lines was changed
        - window resized (columns-number changed)
        - called |foldstaff#option()| on current buffer

Basically, this is used as callback for Folding, called from Vim.
The option setting are more important.
 -> |foldstaff-header-format|, |foldstaff-header-option|
~
                                                      *foldstaff-header-usage*
Setup: ~
    :set foldtext=foldstaff#header()

                                                            *:FoldstaffHeader*
Command: ~
    :FoldstaffHeader {foldlevel} {"filetype"}

        Display the test-generated folded-text of current(cursor) line.

        {foldlevel} is a number greater then or equal to 1.
        {"filetype"} is specifies an arbitrary file-type as string.
        If omitted, the values of the actial buffer is uded.

        The displayed text is also yanked into register {h}.
        If typing `"hp` can paste on Normal-Mode.

                                                          *foldstaff#header()*
Function: ~
    foldstaff#header({lnum}, {foldlevel}, {filetype}) = "folded-text"

        This is almost the same as above Command.
        This returns the folded-text as result, without displaying it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

foldstaff-marker                                            *foldstaff-marker*

This function is set the |fold-marker|, with the right-side aligned.
 -> |foldstaff-marker-option|

Can possible to set the character of fill at margin, for each |foldlevel|.
There is unlimit on number of characters, so you can do something like this. >
  " ( T T)/(^ ^ )`( - -)c(>_< )9_( T T)/(^ ^ )`( - -)c(>_< )9_( T T)/(^ ^ ){{{
<

                                                      *foldstaff-marker-usage*
This function is designed to be used setting to |key-mapping|.
At runtime, it works as follows:

- When executed in Normal-Mode, |fold-marker| will be placed by
  the behind of cursor line.
  - if fold-marker already been placed, then remove it.
  - Two key-mappings are provided, for the Start and End.
    - Markers ware indent by start-marker to the bellow rows,
      and end-marker to the above rows. >
  " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -{{{

- When executed with <count>, place |fold-marker| for it |foldlevel|.
  - if fold-marker already been placed, then replace marker of new |foldlevel|. >
  " ======================================================================{{{1

- When execute in Visual-Mode(multiline selected), will be placed
  start-marker on first-line, and end-marker on last-line. >
  for i in range(10) " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - {{{
    echo i
  endfor " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - }}}
<

                        *<Plug>(foldstaff-marker)* *<Plug>(foldstaff-endmarker)*
Setup:~
    :map zf <Plug>(foldstaff-marker)
    :map zF <Plug>(foldstaff-endmarker)

        This is exsamples of |key-mapping|.
        Feel free to set the actual keys on your like.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

foldstaff-fold                                                *foldstaff-fold*

This function is for 'foldexpr'.  (|fold-expr|)
This function performs folding according to the contents of the buffers.
 -> |foldstaff-fold-option|

This has several fold-types, as follows:
    - type: auto~
      This is the default value.
      The contents of buffer are roughly judged
      and selects type to "code" or "text".

    - type: code~
      This is for Coding or Script buffers.
      This is similar to |fold-indent|, but folding into the
      previous parent-level row. (like as VS-Code)

      The number of lines to be folded can be adjusted with |foldminlines|.

      And you can also add |folding| with following factors:
        + |fold-marker| by Vim                `{{{`,`}}}` :'foldmarker'
          However, |fold-marker| with fold-level are prone to problems...
        + markdown header format symbol     `###` :line-top
        + String of `#region` and `#endregion`

    - type: text~
      This is mainly for Vim-help.

      Separate buffers with the following factors,
      and fold one each separately.
        1. A row with only the letters `=`, `#`, or `/`
        2. A row with only the letters `-`, `+`, or `*`
        3. Paragraph, after 2 or more blank-rows

      As a result, when closing all foldings
      will looks like a CONTENTS or an OUTLINE.

    - type: match~
      Perform folding according to match-pattern, in the option settings.
      This may be easier than preparing a new function for |folding|...


                                      *foldstaff-fold-usage*  *foldstaff#fold()*
Setup:~
    :set |foldmethod|=expr |foldexpr|=foldstaff#fold()

        This complates the set up to a point.
        But it is often overridden by |modeline|, |ftplugin|, or |autocmd|...

        In such cases, plearse execute bellow Command, or re-override
        with |autocmd|, etc. individually.

                                                              *:FoldstaffFold*
Command:~
    :FoldstaffFold {fold-type}

        Performs the folding specified by {fold-type}, on current buffer.
        {fold-type} can be `auto`, `code`, `text`, `match`.
        If not specified, `auto` will be used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

foldstaff-refresh                                          *foldstaff-refresh*

Update the contents of |foldstaff-header| and |foldstaff-fold|.
In fact, it just calls |foldstaff-option| without arguments.

~
Command:~
    :FoldstaffRefresh

Function:~
    :call foldstaff#refresh()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

foldstaff-option                                            *foldstaff-option*

Function for editing options variable of this plugin.
There are 3ways to set the option value:

1. Set `g:foldstaff` in |vimrc|, and have it readed when Vim start.
2. Set `g:foldstaff` and call |foldstaff#option()|.
3. Specify the set option-values as an argument of |foldstaff#option()|
   and execute it.

The 2. & 3. methods are to editing the options as you check them.


                                  *foldstaff-option-usage*  *foldstaff#option()*
Function:~
    foldstaff#option({options}, {flag=0})  =  {options}

        When executed without arguments, it will read the values from
        `g:foldstaff` and overwrite the settings.

        Note: As a result, it returns a DICT-variable of the current settings.

        {options} is a DICT-variable as described below.
         -> |foldstaff-option-variable|
        Specify the values as {filetype}.{method}.{attribute} : {value} >
        ex) {'vim': #{header: #{width: '+0', ellipsis: '~ ',}}}
<        can be set the multiple values, but typing is so tedious...

        {flag} can be a numeric value:
         0      Overrides existing settings
         1      Initialize the settings and then update them
        +2      Displays the current setting values

        To the setting values check only, use following. >
            call foldstaff#option(0, 2)
<
                                                            *:FoldstaffOption*
Command:~
    :FoldstaffOption {filetype}.{method}.{attribute} = {value}

         This is ex-command version.
         When executed without arguments, display current option values,
         and Yank options-variable to register `"h`.

         When setting option, specify {filetype} and {method} can omitted,
         but set by only a Attribute at once.

==============================================================================

OPTION                                               *foldstaff-option-detail*

This section describes the details of each option values.
For on how to Set-Options, please refer to |foldstaff-option|.


option-filetype                                    *foldstaff-option-filetype*

    `_`               This is base-filetype. For values for which there is
                    no-|filetpye| setting, the values for this will be applied.

    `vim`, `help`,.etc  Any |filetypes| you added.
                    This value is a direct reference to the value displayed in
                    `:set filetype?` as key-names in the DICT-variable.
                    That is, it is Case-Sensitive. ~

                    This also allows you you to include Buffers,
                    that do not actually exist as files.
                    On the other hand, it cannot be applied
                    when the |filetype| is undefined...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

header-options                                       *foldstaff-header-option*
~
*foldstaff-header-width*     `=   '+0'`
    Number of |foldstaff-header|(folded-text, closed-|foldtext|) characters.

    Usually, will fill in margin or omit base-text to match is
    this number of characters.
    However, if |winwidth| is small, it will be adjusted accodingly.

    The value be specified as Number or String.
    In the case of Number, it will be the number of characters at the number.
    In the case of String, width is relative to 'textwidth'.
    (this is similar to setting of the |colorcolumn|)

    However, when the Number less than `12`, or the String and 'textwidth'==0,
    the default value of `78` in Vim is applied.

    Note: if you want to always fill the window to edge, a set such as 999999.

~
*foldstaff-header-min*       `=   8`
    If the Text generated by |fodlstaff-header| is too long than
    |foldstaff-header-width|, omit base-text to adjust the number of characters.
    This is the minimum number of characters in that case.

    The sum of this number, characters in |foldstaff-header-ellipsis|, and
    minimum of formatting-text will be the minimum generated-text.

    As a result, the number of characters in the |foldstaff-header-width|
    may be exceeded.

~
*foldstaff-header-ellipsis*  `=   '~'`
    This is String that is added to the base-text to indicate the omission
    when it is omitted.

~
*foldstaff-header-modify* = [[{pat}, {sub}],..]
    Set the substitution-pattern to be executed for the base-text.
    This {pat} and {sub} pairs are used directly for |substitute()|.

    Multiple pairs can be set. Perform the substitutions in the order of set.

    The {flags}:"g" is enabled by default. If you want to disable it,
    "\s" or "\o" into the {pat} top. >
    ex) :FoldstaffOption vim modify.0 = ['\s\vfu%[nction]>\!?', '->']
<
    I think you can do many things with it depending on how you use it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

foldstaff-header-format                              *foldstaff-header-format*

~
foldstaff-header-format `= ['%i%t %<%>%{repeat("[", %v)%}%L]']`

    Specifies the corresponding format-text for each |foldlevel|.
    if less than |foldlevel| is specified, the last item will be used.

    Those format-text consists of |printf()| style "%" items interspersed with
    normal text. |foldtext| is generated by replacing the "%item" part with
    the corresponding content.
    A single percent sign can be given as "%%".

    Note: Numerical include is not supported such as "%04e".

    The correspondence between character specified by "%item" and
    replacement contents is as fllows:

    item        contents ~
    *%t*          base-text. The base-text of the line containing the first
                non-symbolic character from foldstart.
                Pre-replacement by |foldstaff-header-modify| will be performed.

    *%<* ... *%>*   When result text length short than |foldstaff-header-width|,
                fill the margin by repeat string, from between "%< ... %>".

                By placing this inside format-text, you can align right edge.
                If empty, space will be used.  `"%<%>"`
                I think probably supports multi-byte characters. >

<    *%{* ... *%}*   Evaluate expression between "%{ ... %}" and replace to result.
                Note: Order of replacement is "%t" and "%<%>" are last,
                this is order before it.
                That is, you can use other items as arguments to expression. >

~
*foldstaff-marker-fill*      `=   ['- ', '=','_','.']`
    Specify strings to fill in the margin,
    when 'foldmarker' is placed by |foldstaff-marker|.

    The 1st String is used when non level 'foldmarker'.
    Subsequent Strings are used for each level |foldmarker|.
    (If the level of exceeds the number of Strings, the last will be used)

    There is no limit to the number of string and type of characters.
    But please notes that if the string contains 'commentstring' or
    'foldmarker', it will cause problems as buffers language or foldings...

~
*foldstaff-marker-width*     `=   0`
    This specifies the right-aligned position of the |foldstaff-marker|.

    The usage and settings are almost same as the |foldstaff-header-width|.
    However, when the number 0, if refers to the vlue |foldstaff-header-width|.

    "+0" "-6" "+2"              String, relative from 'textwidth'
    36 64 78 100                Number, numeric of characters it number
    0                           Number 0, refer to |foldstaff-header-width|

~
*foldstaff-fold-type*        `=   'auto'`   [auto/code/text/match]
    Specifies the folding method-type(|fold-expr|, 'foldexpr').
    See |foldstaff-fold| for an overview of each type.

    Here is only short introduction:
        "auto"      check the buffer contents and switch to "code" or "text"
        "code"      folding by indent, also supports |foldmarker| and more
        "text"      clip by symbolic line, and folding the individual
        "match"     judge each lines by a setted pattern matching

    In fact, there are only 2 types...
    Type of "match" can only be executed if |foldstaff-fold-match| is set.

~
*foldstaff-fold-keyswitch*   `=   -1`       [0/1/-1]
    Switches Keymap |zo|, |zc| ,and |za| to |zO|, |zC|, and |zA|. (fold open/close/toggle)

    When Folding with type="text" as described above, the folds will overlap.
    This means need to open/close the folding many times...

    This is an option to counter It:
         1          always switch that
         0          not switched
        -1          only when type="text"

    By the way, if |foldstaff-fold| is disabled, this function will not work.

~
*foldstaff-fold-match* = [[{ret}, {pat1}, {pat2},..],..]
    Match patterns for fold-type="match".
    You can set multiple sets of a {ret} and some {pat} as LIST.

    {ret} is set to the return value of |fold-expr|.
    {pat} is set to the match-|pattern| for each lines.

    The machanism is to return the result of {ret} for the rows where
    all {pat} are match.
    If not all matches are found, "=" is returned.

    If there is more than one {pat}, it will inspect the lines around
    the current line for matches.

    It will match each row as follows:     `lnum = current-line` >
        {pat}*1     [{ret}, {lnum}]
        {pat}*2     [{ret}, {lnum-1}, {lnum}]
        {pat}*3     [{ret}, {lnum-1}, {lnum}, {lnum+1}]
        {pat}*4     [{ret}, {lnum-2}, {lnum-1}, {lnum}, {lnum+1}]
        {pat}*5     [{ret}, {lnum-2}, {lnum-1}, {lnum}, {lnum+1}, {lnum+2}]
        {pat}*...   [{ret}, ........]
<    If {pat}=='', it is automatically assumed to be the match.

    As you can imagine, this is a normal and heavy process...
